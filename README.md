# Real-time water quality monitoring using raspberry pi
The need for effective and efficient monitoring, evaluation and control of water quality in residential area has become more demanding in this era of urbanization, pollution and population growth. Ensuring safe water supply of drinking water is big challenge for
modern civilization. Traditional methods that rely on collecting water samples, testing and analyses in water laboratories are not only costly but also lack capability for real-time data capture, analyses and fast dissemination of
information to relevant stakeholders for making timely and informed decisions. In this paper, a real time water quality monitoring system prototype developed for water quality monitoring in Residential home is presented. The
development was preceded by evaluation of prevailing environment including availability of cellular network coverage at the site of operation. The system consists of a Raspberry Pi, Analog to Digital Converter, Water quality
measurement sensors. It detects water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electrical conductivity in real-time and disseminates the information in graphical and tabular formats to relevant stakeholders through a web-based
portal and mobile phone platforms. The experimental results show that the system has great prospect and can be used to operate in real world environment for optimum control and protection of water resources by providing key actors with relevant and timely information to facilitate quick action taking.
